questions:
    - prompt: "What is the main purpose of integrating security checks in each stage of the CI/CD pipeline?"
      options:
       - "To slow down development"
       - "To ensure only DevOps engineers manage security"
       - "To automate deployments without review"
       - "To embed security early and ensure vulnerabilities are caught throughout development"
      correct_index: 3
      explanation: "The key goal is to proactively embed security checks early in the development process and throughout the lifecycle."

    - prompt: "Fill in the blank: The _________ phase includes threat modeling to identify potential vulnerabilities before coding begins."
      options:
        - "Testing"
        - "Planning"
        - "Release"
        - "Build"
      correct_index: 1
      explanation: "The Planning phase includes threat modeling to predict and mitigate future security risks."

    - prompt: "Which of the following best describes DAST?"
      options:
        - "Analyzes code before it is compiled"
        - "Checks application behavior while running"
        - "Ensures business logic is documented"
        - "Analyzes test scripts in the CI environment"
      correct_index: 1
      explanation: "DAST tests the running application to identify vulnerabilities during runtime."

    - prompt: "True or False: The CI/CD pipeline should only have security checks during the testing stage."
      options:
        - "True"
        - "False"
      correct_index: 1
      explanation: "Security checks should be embedded into every stage of the pipeline, not just testing."

    - prompt: "Which of the following is NOT a benefit of combining SAST and DAST?"
      options:
        - "Improves detection coverage of security vulnerabilities"
        - "Provides both code-level and runtime insights"
        - "Replaces the need for security experts"
        - "Strengthens application security across the SDLC"
      correct_index: 2
      explanation: "While SAST and DAST improve coverage, they do not eliminate the need for security professionals."
