questions:
    - prompt: "Which three fields does DevSecOps bring together?"
      options:
        - "Design, Security, Testing"
        - "Development, Security, Operations"
        - "Data, Security, Development"
        - "DevOps, QA, Security"
      correct_index: 1
      explanation: "DevSecOps combines Development, Security, and Operations into a unified approach."

    - prompt: "What is the main purpose of <em>shift left</em> testing?"
      options:
        - "Monitor user behavior in production"
        - "Fix bugs after release"
        - "Improve infrastructure automation"
        - "Implement security testing early in development"
      correct_index: 3
      explanation: | 
                    <em>Shift left</em> testing is about catching security vulnerabilities early in the development process,  allowing developers to identify and fix 
                    vulnerabilities during design and coding phases, rather than discovering them late in testing or production (where fixes are costlier and riskier).

    - prompt: "True or False: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) occurs while the application is running."
      options:
        - "True"
        - "False"
      correct_index: 1
      explanation: "SAST happens before the application compiles. DAST happens during runtime."

    - prompt: "Fill in the blank: In the SDLC, a common issue is that security activities are deferred until the ________ phase."
      options:
        - "planning"
        - "deployment"
        - "testing"
        - "maintenance"
      correct_index: 2
      explanation: "Security is often left until the <b>testing phase</b>, which is too late to catch design-related issues. Addressing security earlier in the SDLC helps reduce the risk of vulnerabilities slipping through."

    - prompt: "Which type of security testing simulates real-world attacks while the app is running?"
      options:
        - Static testing
        - Container scanning
        - Dynamic testing
        - Code linting
      correct_index: 2
      explanation: "Dynamic testing checks for vulnerabilities by simulating attacks while the application runs."
