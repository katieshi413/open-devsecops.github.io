questions:
    - prompt: "What is a container in cloud computing?"
      options:
        - A virtual machine with its own operating system
        - A standardized unit of software packaging code and dependencies to run reliably across environments
        - A cloud storage bucket for applications
        - A physical server hosting multiple applications
      correct_index: 1
      explanation: "Containers package code and all dependencies without the overhead of a full OS, unlike virtual machines."

    - prompt: "Which of the following is NOT a benefit of containerization?"
      options:
        - Portability across environments
        - Isolation of applications
        - Requires full OS boot per container
        - Scalability within a shared OS
      correct_index: 2
      explanation: "Containers do not require booting a full OS for each instance, which makes them lightweight."

    - prompt: "An artifact in containerization typically refers to a ______."
      options:
        - Container image
        - Virtual machine
        - Source code repository
        - Running container
      correct_index: 0
      explanation: "An artifact is the container image, a read-only snapshot used to create containers."

    - prompt: "Which use case is NOT typically associated with containerization?"
      options:
        - Cloud migration of legacy apps
        - Manual updating of IoT devices without containers
        - Microservices architecture deployment
        - Dynamic scaling of applications
      correct_index: 1
      explanation: "Manual updates without containers are complex; containerization simplifies deployment and updates."

    - prompt: "Which of the following best describes fault tolerance in containerization?"
      options:
        - Fault tolerance is not possible in containers
        - One faulty container does not affect others running on the same host
        - Containers share faults between them
        - All containers stop when one container fails
      correct_index: 1
      explanation: "Containers are isolated, so faults in one do not impact others, improving application resilience."
