questions:
    - prompt: "What is the primary purpose of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?"
      options:
        - "To design user interfaces for software applications"
        - "To manage and structure software development and maintenance through distinct phases"
        - "To write code in a specific programming language"
        - "To automate deployment using CI/CD tools"
      correct_index: 1
      explanation: "The SDLC is a structured process that helps manage and guide software development and maintenance through specific phases."

    - prompt: "Which of the following is NOT one of the phases in the traditional SDLC?"
      options:
        - "Design"
        - "Test"
        - "Automate"
        - "Deploy"
      correct_index: 2
      explanation: "<b>Automate</b> is not a standard SDLC phase; the typical phases include Planning, Design, Implement, Test, Deploy, and Maintain."

    - prompt: "True or False: The <b>Maintain</b> phase in SDLC focuses on releasing software into production."
      options:
        - "True"
        - "False"
      correct_index: 1
      explanation: "The <b>Deploy</b> phase handles release into production, while the <b>Maintain</b> phase involves ongoing updates and support."

    - prompt: "What is a key benefit of following a structured SDLC process?"
      options:
        - "Faster typing speed for developers"
        - "Reduces testing requirements"
        - "Ensures secure and reliable software delivery"
        - "Eliminates the need for project planning"
      correct_index: 2
      explanation: "One of the main benefits of SDLC is enabling faster, more secure, and reliable delivery of software through structured processes."

    - prompt: "Which SDLC methodology is best suited for projects with fixed, well-defined requirements?"
      options:
        - "Waterfall"
        - "Agile"
        - "Scrum"
        - "Iterative"
      correct_index: 0
      explanation: "Waterfall is ideal for projects where requirements are fixed and unlikely to change."
