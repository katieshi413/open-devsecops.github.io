![aws iam page](./assets/aws-iam.png)
4. Enter the desired user name, click next, and attach the `AdministratorAccess` policy.
![aws iam permissions page](./assets/aws-iam-perm.png)
5. After creation, click on the new user and navigate to the `Security credentials` tab, and click `Create access key`.
![aws iam permissions page](./assets/aws-iam-access.png)
6. Generate a new access key for the Command Line Interface user case. Make sure to save these credentials securely.

### Configure the AWS CLI
1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command:
```bash
aws configure
```
3. Enter the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key when prompted.
4. Specify the default region (e.g., `us-west-1`). This should be the region where you will deploy the resources.

<hr>

## Setting Up The Infrastructure With Terraform
With the AWS CLI configured, the next step is to set up the actual lab infrastructure using Terraform. Terraform will allow you to automate the deployment of all required AWS resources.

### Clone The Infrastructure Setup Scripts
1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command to clone the lab infrastructure setup repository. This repository contains all the necessary Terraform scripts for various lab topics.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-devsecops/lab-infra-setup.git
```

3. Change into the directory containing the Terraform scripts for Topic 3 DevOps lab:
```bash
cd lab-infra-setup/topic-3-devsecops/aws
```

### Initialize Terraform
1. Within the Topic 3 - DevSecOps directory, initialize Terraform to install necessary providers and set up your environment.
2. In the terminal, enter the following:
```bash
terraform init
```

3. Before applying any changes, review what Terraform intends to do. This command will show you a list of resources that Terraform plans to create.
```bash
terraform plan
```

4. Apply the configuration to begin provisioning the AWS resources.
```bash
terraform apply
```

5. When prompted to `Enter a value:`, enter `yes`.

6. After Terraform successfully applies the configuration, it will output important information such as public IPs, or other commands and other data needed to access your resources.

| Output Name | Description | Usage |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----- |
| **SSH**	      | SSH command to access the EC2 instance.	| Use this command to SSH into the EC2 instance for administrative tasks or troubleshooting. |
| **ec2_public_ip** | The public IP address of the EC2 instance. | Needed to access various web interfaces for the lab, such as downloading VPN configurations, accessing Jenkins, etc. |

{: .warning }
**Please allow sufficient time for tools to install.** After Terraform successfully provisions the AWS resources, it typically takes about 5 minutes for all software tools to be fully installed and operational on the provisioned resources. You can verify completion by entering in the terminal `[ssh command] -f "grep 'Lab Infrastructure Provisioning Complete' /var/log/cloud-init-output.log"`.


### Example Output

```bash
aws_subnet.lab_public_subnet: Creation complete after 1s 
aws_route_table.lab_public_route_table: Creation complete after 1s
aws_route_table_association.lab_pub_sub_rt: Creating...
aws_route_table_association.lab_pub_sub_rt: Creation complete after 1s
aws_security_group.lab: Creation complete after 2s
aws_instance.topic-2-lab: Creating...
aws_instance.topic-2-lab: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
aws_instance.topic-2-lab: Creation complete after 13s

Apply complete! Resources: 16 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

SSH = "ssh -i topic-2-cicd-lab-key.pem ubuntu@54.176.55.245"
ec2_public_ip = "54.176.55.245"
```

## Accessing Internal Services

### Use The VPN Config Generator
1. Navigate to the VPN Config Generator at `https://{ec2_public_ip}`. Replace `{ec2_public_ip}` with the actual public IP address output by Terraform.
![vpn-config page](./assets/vpn-config.png)
2. Download the VPN Configuration file
3. Import the VPN Configuration file into your WireGuard client.
4. Activate the VPN connection using WireGuard to securely connect to the internal network.
5. Access internal services such as `http://dashboard.internal` or `http://jenkins.internal`.

## Configuring Jenkins
Once your infrastructure is ready and you have connected to the internal network via VPN, you can proceed to set up Jenkins for the DevOps labs.

1. Navigate to `http://jenkins.internal` in your web browser.
![jenkins unlock page](./assets/unlock-jenkins.png)
2. To unlock Jenkins and begin setup, you need the initial admin password. Replace `{ec2_public_ip}` in the command below with the public ip in the terraform output.

```bash
ssh -i topic-3-devsecops-lab-key.pem ubuntu@{ec2_public_ip} -f "sudo docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword"
```

{: .important }
Make sure you are in the `topic-3-devsecops/aws` directory where the SSH key is located before you enter the command. 

3. Enter the modified command to retrieve the pasword.

4. Back in your web browser on the Jenkins unlock page, enter the initial admin password you retrieved to unlock 

5. Select the option to Install suggested plugins.
![jenkins install plugins page](./assets/customize-jenkins.png)

6. Once the plugin installation is complete, proceed to the Create First Admin User step.
7. Fill out the form with the admin username, password.
8. On the Instance Configuration page, ensure the Jenkins URL is set to http://jenkins.internal/. This should be populated automatically.

| SonarQube | Static Application Security Testing (SAST) | Manual configuration in SonarQube and Jenkins. |
| Trivy | Container image scanning | Pre-installed, no manual configuration required. |

{: .important }
Ensure that you are connected to the internal network via VPN using the VPN configuration file from the previous steps.

## Configuring SonarQube
![sonarqube dashboard page](./assets/sonarqube-dashboard.png)

SonarQube comes pre-installed, but some manual configuration is needed to integrate the SAST tool into the Jenkins pipeline that students will use for Topic 3 - DevSecOps labs.

### Generating Access Token
1. Navigate to `http://sonarqube.internal`
2. Use the default credentials to log in. 
   - **Username**: `admin`
   - **Password**: `admin`
3. After logging in for the first time, you will be prompted to change the admin password. 
4. Click on the profile icon (top-right corner) and select `My Account`.
5. Navigate to the `Security` tab.
6. Enter a name for the token, select `User Token` as the type, and click Generate.
7. Copy the generated token. This token will be used to configure SonarQube in Jenkins.

### Creating Student Account
To allow students to read the project reports in SonarQube, we need to create a new user account with the appropriate permissions.

1. In SonarQube, go to the `Administration` tab.
2. Click on `Security` in the navigation bar, then select `Users`.
3. Click on the `Create User` button.
4. Enter in the details and click `Create`.
   - **Login**: student
   - **Name**: Student
   - **Password**: student1!

### Creating a New Quality Gate
![sonarqube qualitygate page](./assets/sonarqube-qualitygate.png)

A quality gate is a set of conditions that is used to ensure that the code meets certain standards before it is allowed to proceed through the CI/CD pipeline. The default `Sonar way` quality gate focuses only on _new code_, which means even if new issues and security hotspots are found, the project will pass, and the pipeline will continue to the next step. 

The purpose of this lab is for the students to utilize these tools to fix these issues until all issues and hotspots have been addressed.

We need to create a new quality gate that includes conditions on `Overall Code`, ensuring that the project fails if there are any issues or if all security hotspots have not been reviewed.

1. In SonarQube, go to the `Quality Gates` tab.
2. Click on `Create` to create a new quality gate.
3. Click `Unlock Editing`.
4. Add the following conditions for Overall Code:
   - Issues: is greater than 0
   - Security hotspots reviewed: is less than 100%
5. To make this new quality gate the default, click on the vertical ellipsis icon beside the quality gate name and select `Set as Default`.


### SonarQube and Jenkins Integration
![sonarqube scanner plugin for jenkins page](./assets/sonarqube-jenkins.png)
1. In `http://jenkins.internal`, go to `Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins`.
2. Switch to the Available tab and search for `SonarQube Scanner`.
3. After installing the plugin, go to `Manage Jenkins > System`.
4. Scroll down to the **SonarQube servers** section and click `Add SonarQube`.
5. Enter the following details:
   - **Name**: `sonarqube` (This specific name is important because it is used in the Jenkinsfile within the reference application that the students use to go through the lab exercise)
   - **Server URL**: `http://sonarqube.internal`
   - **Server authentication token**: Use the token you generated from SonarQube.
      - Click `Add > Jenkins` (If the Jenkins button does not appear when you click Add for the authentication token, try saving the configuration first, and then revisiting the SonarQube servers section).
      - Change kind to `Secret text`.
      - Paste in the access token from the previous step into `Secret`
      - Enter in the id.
      - Click `Add`.
      - Select the Jenkins credentials you just generated in `Server authentication token`

6. Click `Save` to save the configuration.
