# Chapter 1 - Cybersecurity Fundamentals

In today’s world, software is constantly exposed to threats that can cause:

- System downtime  
- Data theft  
- Business operation disruptions  

**Cybersecurity** is the practice of protecting digital assets—such as systems, networks, and applications—from malicious cyberattacks.

## The CIA Triad

The **CIA Triad** is a foundational model used to evaluate risks and protect assets.

**CIA = Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability**

- **Confidentiality**: Ensures only authorized users can access data or systems  
- **Integrity**: Ensures data is accurate and hasn't been modified by unauthorized users  
- **Availability**: Ensures information and systems are accessible when needed

## Key Cybersecurity Terms

| Term            | Definition                                                  | Example                                                         |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Vulnerability** | A flaw or weakness in software, hardware, or systems        | A spare key hidden under a doormat                              |
| **Threat Actor**  | An individual or group that intentionally exploits weaknesses | A burglar trying to break into a house                          |
| **Exploit**       | The method used to take advantage of a vulnerability        | The burglar uses the spare key to open the door                |
| **Payload**       | The malicious code or executable used in the attack         | The burglar enters and steals valuables                        |
| **Risk**          | The likelihood and severity of a bad event occurring        | The chance the burglar finds the key, breaks in, and steals valuables |

## Summary

A company with poor security practices is at **greater risk** of:

- A **threat actor** finding a **vulnerability**
- Using an **exploit**
