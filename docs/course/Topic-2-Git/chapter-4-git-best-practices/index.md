# Chapter 4 - Git Best Practices

## Effective Documentation
Proper documentation is key to the longevity and maintainability of software. You want to make sure if you abrubtly leave a project at any point, anyone else can pick it up without talking to you at all.

- **READMEs: Their Role and Key Elements to Include**:
  - A README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. It should include a project title, description, installation instructions, usage, contributing guidelines, license information, and contact information for the maintainers.
  - Use the README to provide a high-level overview of the project and how all the pieces fit together. [Read more...](/https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)

- **Wiki: Using a Project's Wiki for Extensive Documentation**:
  - For more detailed documentation, consider using the project's wiki. It's a great place for tutorials, examples, design notes, or other detailed information that users and contributors may need.

- **Code Comments: Inline Documentation for Code Clarity**:
  - Well-placed comments within the code can clarify complex algorithms, decision-making, or reasons for significant changes.
  - Use comments to explain the *why*, not the *what* — the code speaks for itself on the latter.
