# Chapter 1 - Introduction to SDLC
## What is the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)?

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process used by software developers to build high-quality software applications and manage projects efficiently. It divides software development and maintenance into distinct phases, providing a clear roadmap for teams to follow.

## SDLC Phases

### 1. Planning
Define the project scope, technical and business needs, and any constraints.

### 2. Design
Analyze the requirements to create practical solutions to solve the defined problems.

### 3. Implement
Developers write code to achieve the projectâ€™s design goals.

### 4. Test
Use automated and manual testing methods to identify bugs or errors in the software.

### 5. Deploy
Release the completed software into a production environment for user access.

### 6. Maintain
Continuously update and support the software to address issues and improvements.

## Benefits of SDLC

- Structured project management aligned to product goals  
- Improved communication and collaboration between teams  
- Built-in risk mitigation throughout each phase  
- Reduces human error through rigorous testing  
- Enables faster, more secure, and reliable software delivery

## Common SDLC Methodologies

| Methodology | Description | Use Cases |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Waterfall** | A linear approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. | Ideal for small, well-defined projects with fixed requirements. |
| **Iterative** | Builds software in small parts, allowing feedback and revisions after each iteration. | Useful when early versions are expected to evolve based on user feedback. |
| **Agile** | A flexible, iterative approach that emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and frequent updates. | Best for dynamic, fast-paced projects with evolving requirements. |
| **Scrum** | A subset of Agile, focusing on time-boxed iterations called sprints and daily stand-up meetings. | Great for product-based development with frequent releases and tight deadlines. |
