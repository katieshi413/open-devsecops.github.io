# 📚 Documentation Overview

This section contains supporting documentation for the project. You’ll find two main categories:

- **References**: Resources, tools, and guides that informed our approach.
- **User Research**: Findings and insights gathered through interviews, surveys, and usability testing.

Each document provides context and justification for design and development decisions, helping to ensure that our work is user-centered, informed, and aligned with best practices.
